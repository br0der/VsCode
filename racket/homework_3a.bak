; A PS (Photo Shoot) is one of:
; - (make-launch Number Interval)
(define-struct launch [photographer goal])


; - (make-flight Number Interval Posn)
(define-struct flight [photographer goal drone])

; Where:
;   - photographer represents a photographer's x-coordinate on the ground
;   - goal represents the range of the desired image to to be captured at the ground-level (interval)
;   - drone (if any) represents the drone's x/y position (with 0, 0 at the bottom left)
; All numbers are measured in pixels.
 
; An Interval is a (make-interval Number Number)
(define-struct interval [left right])
; and represents the leftmost and rightmost range of an interval in pixel coordinates (inclusive)

;EXERCISE 2
;PS -> PS
;Purpose: this function, given a PS, moves the drone (if any) down by 1 pixel.

(define (falling-drone PS)
  (cond
    [(flight? PS) 
     (make-flight (flight-photographer PS) (flight-goal PS) (make-posn (posn-x (flight-drone PS)) (-(posn-y (flight-drone PS))1))   ) ]
    [(launch? PS) PS]
    )
  )

(check-expect (falling-drone (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER1 GOAL DRONE1) ) (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER1 GOAL (make-posn 1 -1)))
(check-expect (falling-drone (make-launch PHOTOGRAPHER2 GOAL  ) ) (make-launch PHOTOGRAPHER2 GOAL ))




;EXERCISE 3

;PS->PS
;Purpose: this function, given a PS without a drone in flight, puts the drone
;in flight at 20 pixels in the air and 15 pixels to the right of the photographer.

(define (launch-drone PS)
  
  (cond
    [(launch? PS)(make-flight (launch-photographer PS) (launch-goal PS) (make-posn (+ 15 (launch-photographer PS)) 20))]
    [(flight? PS) PS]
    
   )

)

(check-expect (launch-drone (make-launch PHOTOGRAPHER3 GOAL)) (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER3 GOAL (make-posn (+ PHOTOGRAPHER3 15) 20)))

;EXERCISE 4

;PS->boolean
;Purpose: this function determines if the shoot is over. The shoot is over if the
;drone has crashed (height = 0), or if the drone has captured the goal.

(define (shoot-over? PS)
  (cond
    [(flight? PS) (cond [(= (posn-y(flight-drone PS)) 0) #true]
                        [(and (>= (/ (posn-y (flight-drone PS))2) (interval-left (flight-goal PS))) (>= (/ (posn-y (flight-drone PS))2) (interval-right (flight-goal PS))) ) #true]
                        [else #false]

                        )       
     ]
    [else #false]
   )
  )

(check-expect (shoot-over? (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER2 GOAL DRONE1) ) #true)
(check-expect (shoot-over? (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER2 GOAL DRONE3) ) #false )
(check-expect (shoot-over? (make-flight PHOTOGRAPHER2 GOAL DRONE4) ) #true )
